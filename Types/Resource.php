A resource is a special variable, holding a reference to an external resource.

The special null value represents a variable with no value. null is the only possible value of type null. 

A variable is considered to be null if: 

◦ it has been assigned the constant null. 


◦ it has not been set to any value yet. 


◦ it has been unset(). 



There is only one value of type null, and that is the case-insensitive constant null. 




<?php
$var = NULL;       
?>
